# Simple Foods API

## What Is Simple Food?

Simple food means food made from fewer ingredients and less processing. The idea is straightforward: the closer something is to its natural state, the easier it is to understand, prepare, and trust. Simple foods make it easier for people to eat well without decoding long ingredient lists or artificial additives.

## Use Cases

The **Simple Foods API** helps developers quickly deliver clear, ingredient-focused insights to their users.
Instead of building complex nutrition databases from scratch, this API provides direct access to:

- **Ingredient breakdowns** — see what’s inside a product at a glance
- **Alternative suggestions** — find simpler replacements for highly processed foods

It’s designed to integrate easily into nutrition apps, recipe platforms, and health dashboards that want to make eating simpler without managing large datasets.

## Why It Exists

Existing databases like the USDA Branded Foods Table or Open Foods API are powerful but often broad, technical, and time-consuming to adapt for user-friendly features.
The Simple Foods API narrows the focus to **what most users actually want to know:**

> “What’s in my food, and is there a simpler option?”

By offering a streamlined structure and curated simplicity data, this API helps developers serve their clients faster, cut down on data wrangling, and focus on building better user experiences — not maintaining massive food tables.
